# anisotropy_prediction

Perform statistical analysis and data conditioning of well log data, use predictive modeling to estimate vertical resistivity and electrical anisotropy using commonly available well log parameters. Follow-on from [work presented at EAGE 2016](http://www.rocksolidimages.com/pdf/2016_EAGE_Predicting_Electrical_Anisotropy.pdf).  

As the input data are covered by an NDA, and the results cannot be fully shared prior to publication, the code is private at this time, but may be made available, in whole or part, at a later time.
